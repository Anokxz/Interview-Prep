## 1. Mechanics  
Mechanics deals with motion, forces, energy, and interactions of objects.  

### **Newton's Laws of Motion**

   - A body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion continues in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.  
2. **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**  
   - The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of the force.  
   - **Formula:** `F = ma` (Force = mass × acceleration)  
3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)**  
   - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
