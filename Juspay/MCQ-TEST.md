# Physics Notes

## 1. Mechanics  
Mechanics deals with motion, forces, energy, and interactions of objects.  

### **Newton's Laws of Motion**  
1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**  
   - A body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion continues in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.  
2. **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**  
   - The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of the force.  
   - **Formula:** `F = ma` (Force = mass × acceleration)  
3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)**  
   - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
   - **Formula:** `F_action = -F_reaction`  

### **Kinematics (Motion without Forces)**  
- **Velocity:** `v = distance / time`  
- **Acceleration:** `a = Δv / Δt`  
- **Equations of Motion:**  
  - `v = u + at`  
  - `s = ut + 1/2 at^2`  
  - `v^2 = u^2 + 2as`  

### **Momentum & Impulse**  
- **Momentum:** `p = mv`  
- **Impulse:** `J = F Δt`  
- **Conservation of Momentum:** `m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2`  

### **Work, Energy, and Power**  
- **Work:** `W = Fd cos(θ)`  
- **Kinetic Energy:** `KE = 1/2 mv^2`  
- **Potential Energy:** `PE = mgh`  
- **Power:** `P = W / t`

## 2. Electricity & Magnetism  
This section deals with electric charges, currents, and magnetic effects.  

### **Basic Laws**  
- **Ohm’s Law:** `V = IR`  
- **Kirchhoff’s Laws:**  
  - **Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL):** Total current entering a junction = Total current leaving.  
  - **Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL):** Sum of voltage drops in a loop = 0.  

### **Capacitance & Inductance**  
- **Capacitance:** `C = Q / V`  
- **Energy in a Capacitor:** `E = 1/2 CV^2`  
- **Inductance:** `V = L dI/dt`  

### **AC Circuits**  
- **Reactance of Capacitor:** `X_C = 1 / (ωC)`  
- **Reactance of Inductor:** `X_L = ωL`  
- **Power in AC:** `P = VI cos(φ)`

## 3. Thermodynamics  
This section covers heat, energy, and transformations.  

### **Laws of Thermodynamics**  
1. **First Law (Conservation of Energy)** – Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.  
   - `ΔU = Q - W`  
2. **Second Law** – Heat flows from hot to cold naturally. Entropy always increases.  
3. **Third Law** – As temperature approaches absolute zero, entropy approaches a constant value.  

### **Heat Transfer**  
- **Conduction:** `Q = kA (ΔT / d)`  
- **Convection:** Heat transfer due to fluid movement.  
- **Radiation:** `Q = σ A T^4`

## 4. Waves & Optics  
Deals with wave behavior and light properties.  

### **Wave Properties**  
- **Wave Equation:** `v = fλ`  
- **Sound Intensity:** `I = P / A`  

### **Optics Basics**  
- **Reflection:** Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection.  
- **Refraction (Snell’s Law):** `n1 sin(θ1) = n2 sin(θ2)`  
- **Lens Formula:** `1/f = 1/v - 1/u`

## 5. Modern Physics  
This section includes advanced physics concepts.  

### **Photoelectric Effect**  
- **Einstein’s Equation:** `hf = KE_max + φ`  

### **Semiconductors**  
- **Intrinsic & Extrinsic Semiconductors:** P-type and N-type doping.  
- **Diode Equation:** `I = I_0 (e^(qV/kT) -1)`
